    <h6 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h6>
    <p class="speech">I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
        But he says I am not serious enough.</p>

    <h6 class="name hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>
    <p class="speech">My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this
        house. Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in
        which we all live. She won’t go into it. She is far too good. I
        consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night. It gave
        quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.</p>

    <h6 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
        the air.</p>

    <h6 class="name hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>
    <p class="speech">My dear, how can you say that? There is no resemblance
    between the two things at all. But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
    not being suitable?</p>

    <h6 class="name gerald">GERALD</h6>
    <p class="speech">Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.</p>

    <h6 class="name hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>
    <p class="speech">But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any
    views of life. They are quite out of place. You must be guided by
    others in this matter. Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
    offer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at
    least, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay
    with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in
    your career</p>
